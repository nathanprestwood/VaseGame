    <string name="help_text">\tThe goal of the game is simple, get 41 in any bucket. There are three buckets with capacity for 81, 51 and 31 each.\n\n\t
    You can only fill in a bucket completely or empty it completely but you can also transfer water from one to another until either on bucket is full or the other is empty.\n\n\t
    The time you take will be recorded and your games will be stored in your phone and if you sign in with a Google account it will also be saved in the cloud.\n\n\t
    If you play when you don\'t have internet access don\'t forget to sync your games by tapping in Score and then Sync.\n
    \n\n\t\t That\'s it! You\'re ready to play!</string>
